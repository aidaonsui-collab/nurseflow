- **76%** feel inadequately prepared to use their EHR
- Poor EHR usability directly linked to burnout
- High click loads and frequent task switching
- Fragmented and inefficient workflows

### Scheduling
- Manual scheduling prone to errors
- Doesn't consider individual preferences
- Leads to burnout and high turnover
- Overlapping shifts, understaffed units, frequent overtime
- Existing software (UKG) rated as not user-friendly

### Handoff Reporting
- **67%** error rate in handoff sheets
- Missing allergy and weight info
- Incorrect medication information
- Lack of standardized protocols

### Medication Administration
- Interruptions during medication prep cause errors
- Ambiguous documentation leads to inconsistent administration plans
- Lack of systematic feedback on error-inducing factors
- Need better reporting mechanisms

## Opportunity Areas

### High-Priority Solutions Needed:
1. **AI-powered documentation assistant** - voice-to-note, auto-fill from conversations
2. **Simplified handoff tool** - mobile-friendly, standardized, reduces errors
3. **Smart scheduling** - preference-aware, predictive staffing needs
4. **Medication verification workflow** - reduce interruptions, improve checks
5. **Real-time feedback system** - for documentation errors and improvements

### Market Gap:
- Most solutions are enterprise-focused, expensive
- Lack of simple, nurse-friendly tools
- No major platform focused on Texas-specific nursing needs
